# Success in Programming: How to Gain Recognition, Power, and Influence through Personal Branding
By: Frédéric Harper

## Chapter 1: Personal What? 

### What is Personal Branding?
Personal branding is the art of consistently presenting, online and offline, the essence of how you stand out from the crowd.

Personal branding is one of the keys that will help you achieve your goal.

Experience does make personal branding easier
- Bigger network
- Better idea of what you want to do next

Personal branding is 
- Trying to achieve association of one word, sensation feeling, image, or memory with yourself.
- Thinking about yourself as a brand.
- How people see you
  - Who you are, what you do, who you know, what you share, and many more, your tribe
  - Everything that defines you
- Marketing yourself and your career

Tips for personal branding:

- Separate yourself from the herd in some way
  - Stand out from the crowd in some way
- Determine the level you want to reach
  - e.g Company level, national level, etc  
- Think local
  - company, city, your network
- Personal branding won't happen by magic, if you don't dedicate the time to improve your life and career, it won't happen by itself
- Take pleasure from working on your personal brand, otherwise it isn't worth it and won't work

Ideas of doing something good enough to be remembered:
- Solve a critical bug at work
- Start a user group
- Contribute to an open-source project
- Write a book
- Give a talk at a local conference

## Chapter 2: I'm Not a Rock Star

### So Why Should I Care? 

No matter what job you do, branding is critical in today's world. You can't be average, you need to differentiate yourself and achieve visibility. 

#### 1. You are not indispensable

- More employers in the industry are embracing remote work.
    - Even as a freelancer, your customers can find new partners at any moment, from anywhere in the world
    - University degrees have less impact than they used to

Actions
- Let future employers/customers know what you are capable of 
  - Showcase experience and expertise by showing code examples on GitHub


#### 2. No job is secure

You can lose your job anytime

#### 3. New opportunitites ahead

There may be a next step to take in the career you already have.
  - e.g. doing something new in the industry
  - e.g. new position in the company with challenges you would like to take one
  - e.g. another company you dreamed of working for
  - e.g. reaching the next level in your current role
  

#### 4. Thinking beyond yourself

Personal branding isn't just about you.
The goal is to improve situation and reach new goals
Personal branding will also have an impact on others' lives more than you think.

Surround yourself with people who are more brilliant than you
- Learn from them and become better

By being the most brilliant person, you will help others and they will achieve their goals too

Lead by example
By going the extra mile, if you believe in the power of personal branding, others around you will too. By working on your brand, you'll also improve your skills, have a bigger impact, and get more visibility. The people around you will benefit from it.

Tips:
- Personal branding itself will not make you more happy with your life, but the results of it might
- Happiness is contagious
  - If you are happy, personal branding will make a difference in your life and the lives of others
  - if you're happier, the people around you will also be happier
  
  
#### 5. Maslow's hierarchy of needs

| Needs              |                                                                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Self-actualization | Morality, creativity, spontaneity, problem solving, lack of prejudice, acceptance of facts |
| Esteem             | Self-esteem, confidence, achievement, respect of others, respect by others                 |
| Love/belonging     | Friendship, family, sexual intimacy                                                        |
| Safety             | Security of: body, employment, resources, morality, the family, health, property           |
| Physiological      | Breathing, food, water, sex, sleep, homeostasis, excretion                                 |

Tips:
- If you have no real passion for what you do, or don't like it, you're setting yourself up for failure
- Like any human being, you want recognition from your peers and respect from others. You also want to be confident and have a healthy self-esteem.
- Only when you've fulfilled most of your basic needs can you aim for a higher peak


#### 6. You are already being branded

You already have a personal brand, people already define you, in both good and bad ways, and who you are is already something of a brand to others.

Everything you do has an impact on your brand.

With personal branding, you learn how to help those people have the right opinion about you

It's not about manipulating people or being anything other than yourself. It's about improving your brand and make it stronger


#### Tips 

##### Fighting the imposter syndrome
- Don't be a victim of the imposter syndrome.
- You worked hard to be where you are right now. Even if you're not successful yet, you deserve to be.
- Realize that each brand is unique (like humans are)

##### Author's story on building his own brand

- Make a list of skills and experience you need to build your brand and work on them
- Get out there and do it!


##### Nothing will happen by magic

- You need to work to achieve your goals
- Make your own luck
- Personal branding can help you create your own luck, approach your end goals and make them a reality

##### Start now

- Continuously update your LinkedIn profile and resume
- Start networking 
- Be proactive, not reactive
- Building your personal brand is not done in one day, it will be a long but worthwhile journey


## Chapter 3: Me, Myself, and I

Tips:
- Be visible, but don't steal other people's thunder. Always attribute where attribution is due and tell people when you advocate their work for them. 

### THE WHO (Who are you?)

#### Define who you are
  - Take this as an opportunity to do some introspection
  - e.g. Take personality tests, answer personality questions, etc

##### Be authentic

##### Past, Present, and Future

Who you are is also built on your past and your future -- who you were and who you want to be and what you would like to change about you.

This is not about being someone else -- never be someone else.

##### What is your elevator pitch?

Define yourself in a tweet, using 140 characters.

The elevator pitch is a summary used to define your value proposition. It is a good starter for a situation when you meet someone new.

Try to include everything that is important to know about you
- Personal traits
- Hobbies
- Your career
- The programming languages you know
- ... etc ... There are no limitations

Keep refining your elevator pitch

##### Scratching the surface is not enough

Think of who you are in a more exhaustive way.

Answer the following questions that makes sense for you with a small sentence or a few words. Don't overthink. This exercise helps define what is important to you.

- What are your strengths?
- What are your weaknesses?
- How do you normally dress?
- What is your work experience?
- What are you proudest of?
- What foods do you like?
- What kind of music do you like?
- What is your marital/family status?
- Do you like to travel?
- What are your passions?
- What are your hobbies?
- Is religion important for you?
- Do you have pets?
- What are your favorite websites?
- What is important to you in life?
- What is not important for you?
- What makes you happy?
- What makes you sad?
- What makes you mad?
- What superpower would you like to have (or already have)?

##### How others see you

How others see you is extremely important.

Another exercise to do is to ask your network, `How do you see me, and what kind of person do you think I am?`. Ask anyone you know and you may be surprised by the answers you'll get -- it may solidify what you thought about yourself, or it may provide new insights about yourself. 

##### Focus on your strengths

Be a big believer in self-improvement. There are many ways to do this.

Improvement is about more than building up your weaknesses. You can instead improve your strengths and reach the next level. 

Spend most of your time focusing on your strengths as this creates more impact, not that we shouldn't work on our weaknesses.

Guidelines:
- 80% improve your strengths, 20% working on your weaknesses
- Work on no more than 1 weakness and 2 strengths at a time

Tips:
- Find what your strengths are
  - Recommended book: `Strength Finder 2.0 by Tom Rath (Gallup Press, 2007)`

##### What differentiates you from others?

- Anything that makes you different is something to highlight
- Focus on the personal side
  - It's about you, not just your skills

##### It's only the beginning

Define
- Who you are
  - Strengths
  - Weaknesses
- How people see you
- What makes you different


## Chapter 4: Defining Your Brand: Are You a Ninja, a Pirate, or a Rock Star?

### THE WHAT

There are many ways to define good developers. Define your brand and manage it as a professional, instead of letting others do it for you.

Working on your brand is about leadership.

Tips:
- Start thinking about your interests and the impact you want to have in the developer world
- Take ownership of everything you possible can to build up that personal brand for yourself
- Engage as a thought leader
  - New opportunities will open themselves up to you
  
- When you find that thing that you feel passionately about, spend any chance you get to be a sponge and learn everything you can about it and the community. 
- It's also valuable to learn from people who have completely contradictory opinions from your own

### Defining your goal

What is the next level? What do you want to achieve with your career? What is your end goal? 

You'll never be successful with your personal brand if you don't know WHY you're doing it.

- Is it about getting your dream job?
- Is it about getting a bigger paycheck?
- Is it about getting more visibility?
- Is it about building new skills or competencies?
- Is it some other goal?

The next step doesn't have to be management

##### Stairway to heaven

Your goal should be as large as it has to be: Think big. Nothing is unattainable.

But it's easier if you have stairs -- go step by step. You need to think in terms of milestones to reach your goal.

Breaking a goal down into action steps can help you boost your morale and make it easier to create a plan on achieving your larger goal.

##### Make it quantifiable

You need to be able to evaluate and measure your goals to know if you hit your targets. 

##### Setting your timeline: You don't have a TARDIS

Define a timeline -- When will you achieve your goals? When should each of those steps by accomplished?

Deadlines help prevent you from working on a never ending goal or constantly pushing it to the back burner because it's not due yet.

Tips:
- Use months as the metric over years
- Try not to have a subgoal that takes longer than 1 year
  - Split those up into smaller goals

##### Your goal may change, it will change, it should change

The goal itself can change. The milestones can change. The timeline can change.

What happens when you reach your goal? Is there anything else? A new goal? Yes. There's always a next step.

### Defining your brand
- How can you differentiate yourself? Differentiating yourself is important
- Don't be a copy cat, but...
List people with a strong brand, focus on 2-3 people who have a personal brand you like, a brand you would like to have. What do these people have in common? What did they do? What do you like about their brand? This can give you an idea of what could be your brand.

- What is your actual brand?
  - Who you are (80%)
  - Who you want to be (20%)
  
It's not about inventing something.

#### The trilogy of your life: past, present, and future
The professional side of your brand is based on the present, on who you are right now—but also on the past, as well as the future

##### The past
What do you want to highlight from your past experience?

##### Living the moment
The past clearly shaped who you are right now, but is there anything else you want to add?

##### The Last 20%: Be a Seer
Focus on what you can change and improve, and where you want to go.
This is not about lying, but it’s also not limited to who you are right now, either.

#### Unleashing the kraken
Release the beast.

Summary of creating your brand:
- Who you are on a personal level
- What you’ve done on a professional level
- Who you are, right now, on a professional level
- What differentiates you from others
- Who you want to be or what you can improve (look into the future)

##### Half the work is done
You are now more conscious about your personal brand because you have defined it.

You still have to take control of your image and lead your brand.
